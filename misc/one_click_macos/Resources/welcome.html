        <p style="color: #020202; font-size: 11px;">TODO CHECK TEXT AlphaMap is an open-source Python package that provides fast accession and visualization of unprocessed LC-TIMS-Q-TOF data from Brukerâ€™s timsTOF Pro instruments. It indexes the data such that it can easily be sliced along all five dimensions: LC, TIMS, QUADRUPOLE, TOF and DETECTOR.</p>
